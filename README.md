## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Purpose

This submission includes attempted one-to-one recreations of the visualisations in ["Net favourability gap between Conservatives and Labour smallest in nearly four years"](https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/52795-political-favourability-ratings-august-2025) in Python and plotnine, originally published by [Dylan Difford](https://yougov.co.uk/people/dylan.difford), a Junior Data Journalist at YouGov, on August 19, 2025.

All of the plots are built using [`plotnine`](https://plotnine.org/), an implementatin of R's `{ggplot2}` package in Python. 

This submission shows how examples of effective data visualisation found "in-the-wild" can be recreated with the `plotnine` package. It also contains some surprises I found and reflections I had as an R user who only infrequently works in Python.

## üóÉÔ∏è The Repository

The code in this repository is completely reproducible, and builds a [quarto](https://quarto.org/) HTML page with all of the plots contained within. Ensure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, then run the below commands to create a Python virtual environment and render the content.

```bash
uv sync
uv run quarto render
```

Note that no extraneous data is required to reproduce the plots; all data is contained within this repository in CSV files.

## üëã About the Author
**I am a senior consultant and data analyst working for an Environmental Consultancy in South Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom.** My work typically involves writing dynamic reports, creating effective data visualisations, authoring Shiny web apps, writing and maintaining R packages, facilitating training workshops, and otherwise writing code to do interesting things with data. I'm a collaborator on the [{openair} project](https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openair) and the lead developer on the [{openairmaps}](https://github.com/davidcarslaw/openairmaps) R package. My main programming language is **R**, but I dabble in Python and JavaScript.
